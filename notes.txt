========== Note from Stephane @ FLI [March 14, 2018] ==============


After each answer of the camera, you get the following additional sequence of character:  
CR LF “fli-cli>” ( ‘\r’ ‘\n’ ‘f’ ‘l’ ‘i’ ‘-‘ ’c’ ‘l’ ‘i’ ‘>’ ).

Not only CR (=0D). Some display commands send some CR before the end of the command.


========== Notes from Dan [March 14, 2018] ========================

- I tried running the camera with the prior config file and it failed. 
Luckily, Cliff from EDT helped me modify the file and get everything working.

- The only change is in line 78: [#htaps: 2] needs to be uncommented and changed to 4 [htaps: 4]

- Cliff also noted that we may have to play with the bitdepth in the future:

     - 16 will work since the camera outputs 16bit streams. However, since 
     the data itself is 14 bit, the images may come out dimmer than expected.

     - He says we can play with lines 39, 40, and 55 in the file. Mix and 
     match 14, 16, and 3D accordingly to see if the image improves.

- Finally, if you try to use vlviewer, directly, it crashes when you load the config file. 
Cliff does not know what is causing this. 
However, you can initialize the camera separately and then open vlviewer and that'll work. 
Once this is done, vlviewer will run as expected. Here is the order of commands to run:

     1) ./initcam -c 0 -f camera_config/DE2_generic16cl.cfg

                 [this initializes the FG and sets the config file]

     2) ./vlviewer

                 [open vlviewer bypassing the config selection since this is already done]


Cliff said he would look into the last problem (vlviewer crashing on config selection) and let us know if he figured something out.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
